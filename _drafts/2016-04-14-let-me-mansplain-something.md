I read/follow a fair amount of feminist voices. They just make sense to me. And when they don't, I find that they generally open my eyes, and I start to slowly recognize something I was missing before.

One I'm still struggling with is the concept of "mansplaining". (Yes, I recognize the irony in me explaining this.)

It may be how I was introduced to the concept that has skewed my reception but I generally understand it as men, especially older men, talking down to women or explaining something to them from the perspective of them knowing better. The best examples tend to be when some guy explaining something he knows worse than the recipient, assuming he knows better seemingly because he's older and/or male. The first example I was introduced to was a younger woman studying med student stuff on the subway and some random old dude just teaching her random, incorrect stuff about the human body. That's hilariously frustrating.

I'm not denying that this happens and that it often come from sexist origins. I just mostly struggle with it being a pervasively different issue than human beings being know-it-alls overall. I understand that in instances where it's a man talking down to a woman it increases the gratingness but I wonder if it ascribes too much weight to it being a man and not enough to old people.

People get more years (or they like to call it "experience") behind them, and they think they're doing you a favor by sharing it with you unsolicited.

Because I recognize where the idea comes from (men's over-confidence and power historically), I submit a similar concept that I believe is *very* true. I don't have a name for it. I'm talking about the heaping of praise that men bestow as if it should be some sort of honor to get their praise. The best example I can think of is something I see constantly and only from men: That thing where a man will agree with something or appreciate something at an event such as a concert or sporting event and they'll applaud over their head. What the hell is that? It has that sort of "Bravo. You deserve my approval." feel to it and it's bogus.
