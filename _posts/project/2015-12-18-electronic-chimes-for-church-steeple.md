My grandma's church has an old 8-track system from the late 1960s that plays fake carillon sounds at set times. It has stopped working and they asked me to look at it. All I could figure was the amp was blown on it but I'm not good at diagnosing that stuff.

{% assign image = page.images[0] %}
{% include image.html image=image %}

Instead I thought I'd try to improve upon their current model considering it runs on one 8 track of about 20 songs and is impossibly cryptic.

So I've ordered some parts from Adafruit and going to try my hand at a full-blown Arduino project.
