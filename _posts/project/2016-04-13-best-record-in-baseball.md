I've been wanting to learn and use some D3 for data visualization. I'd done the typical (for me at least) Reading the First Half of a Programming Book. I also took a D3 Lynda course so I had *something* to show even if it was the standard follow what the dude did on a screen.

Although I still had a bunch of questions, I thought it'd be best to get my hands dirty and search for answers as I went. I've maintained a list of ideas for visualizations for some time but to get started, I wanted to focus more on the tool and less on the design so I decided to go with an existing one that I've always wanted to improve on.

Craig Robinson is great. He's a great artist, critic and baseball fan. He's a dude who is from England, discovered baseball while visiting the US with his job in Germany, then watched the Blue Jays while living in Toronto and now lives in Mexico City. Ba
