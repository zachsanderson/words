>I mean, c'mon...I mean are you kidding me?
<cite>&mdash; actual rebuttal from the most reasonable Republican candidate, John Kasich</cite>

Several times recently, I, as a member of the collective "people on Facebook", have been chastised for building a bubble and choosing what I want to see by hiding/unfriending people who post opposing political views. I reacted by taking my lumps and agreeing. Guilty as charged pretty much.

(It should be noted my reaction was internal and not on Facebook. Politics don't belong on that feed. It's for engagement photos and seeing everything ever Liked by a distant relative.)

But now I'm watching the Republican debate and, like when you have a good response later that night while laying in bed, I'm ready to argue back.

Where these posts, and so much of the 50% vs. 50% mentality, get it wrong is assuming things are on even ground. The Two Sides are completely different. I'm totally cool with the conservative approach to a solution to a problem. I still might disagree with it but I'm fine with considering it.

But what gets presented as a conservative idea on Facebook or on the stage tonight is embarrassing. I have this thing, that I assume other people have too, where I get embarrassed for people. The earliest example that comes to mind was the [Boom Goes the Dynamite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45DRy7M1no "Boom Goes the Dynamite") kid? When I saw it, I wasn't able to sit straight through it. I had to pause it about every 10 seconds and steel myself.

There's obviously nothing wrong with the kid himself and I'm sure he got better. But to think it would be more noble for me to sit through it all while he tries to figure it out is sadistic.
