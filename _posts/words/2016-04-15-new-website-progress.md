There are some things I think of as bowties (though relevant, I'm not talking about these [bowties](https://bowtie.io/ "Bowtie.io")). I always feel like I should know how to tie a bowtie, but then I realize learning to tie a bowtie just means I'm then wearing a bowtie. I don't want that.

That's kind of how I feel about Wordpress. There's nothing wrong with Wordpress. It'd been running my blog for some time. I kept thinking I should dig into it more but then I'd be learning more about something I don't really care about.
