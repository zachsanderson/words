For Thanksgiving this year, Jayne and I went down to my parents' place in Lexington. I took photos of my mom working around the farm and of some bulls she's looking to sell.

On a clear full moon night, we drove down to Cumberland Falls to look for a moonbow. Cumberland Falls is one of the few waterfalls that creates a moonbow when the moon is full. Locals told us that this was the first one that was visible in several months and some said it was the brightest they'd ever seen.
